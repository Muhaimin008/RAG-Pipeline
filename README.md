# RAG-Pipeline
This repository contains a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline designed to automatically extract and answer multiple-choice questions (MCQs) from Enlish & Bangla-language educational PDFs. It‚Äôs built to run seamlessly on **Google Colab**, ensuring ease of use in resource-constrained settings and supporting future extensibility.

The system integrates OCR, semantic chunking, vector similarity search, and OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-based generation to provide context-aware answers. Its modular design encourages adaptation for a broader range of educational and low-resource NLP applications.

## üöÄ Features

### ‚úÖ Google Colab Ready

Runs entirely in Google Colab, so there is no setup hassle. Ideal for rapid prototyping and sharing with educators or researchers.

### üìÑ OCR with `pytesseract`

Most Bangla textbooks are scanned images. We use Tesseract OCR to convert images to text, enabling downstream NLP tasks.

### üñº PDF Conversion with `pdf2image`

Converts each PDF page to an image for OCR. Crucial for handling non-digital (scanned) documents.

### ‚úÇÔ∏è Smart Chunking

The text is chunked into overlapping semantic units using sentence-based splitting. This preserves context during retrieval.

### üîç Embedding + FAISS Retrieval

Text chunks are embedded using OpenAI's `text-embedding-3-small` model, and similarity search is powered by FAISS. This combination balances performance, accuracy, and cost.

### üß† GPT-4 Answer Generation

Once relevant chunks are retrieved, GPT-4 generates grounded answers in Bangla, handling both inline and tabular MCQ formats.

## üì¶ Installation & Dependencies

If running locally (not on Colab), install the following:

```bash
pip install openai faiss-cpu pytesseract pdf2image python-dotenv numpy
```

You will also need to install Tesseract OCR manually:

* Ubuntu: `sudo apt install tesseract-ocr`
* Windows: [Tesseract Download](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract)

For Google Colab, just ensure these libraries are installed via code cells.

## üõ† How to Use (Colab Instructions)

1. Open the notebook in Colab.
2. Upload a scanned Bangla PDF (e.g., textbook).
3. Set your OpenAI API key:

   ```python
   import os
   os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your-key-here"
   ```
4. Run the processing pipeline:

   ```python
   chunks, emb_model, all_indices, mcq_answers, full_text = initialize_rag("yourfile.pdf", os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))
   comparative_query_loop(chunks, all_indices, emb_model, os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"), mcq_answers, full_text)
   ```
5. Ask questions in Bangla or English. Type `exit` to end.

## üß™ Evaluation

* ‚úÖ Handles inline and tabular MCQ formats
* ‚úÖ Effective retrieval with FAISS + embeddings
* ‚ö†Ô∏è OCR sensitivity: scan quality impacts results
* ‚ö†Ô∏è Ambiguous queries may reduce grounding accuracy

## üîÆ Future Extensions

This project was designed with future upgrades in mind:

* Integrate Layout-aware OCR (`layoutparser`) for better MCQ structure detection
* Replace embedding model with multilingual or Bangla-specialized versions
* Build a front-end interface for teachers/students
* Deploy as a REST API or add a Flask/FastAPI wrapper
* Add analytics for performance evaluation (e.g., accuracy, F1-score)

## üí° Design Highlights

* **OCR first**: Enables processing of non-digital textbooks
* **Semantic chunking**: Improves retrieval by preserving logical flow
* **Embeddings**: Efficient context matching across large text volumes
* **LLM grounding**: Ensures answers are drawn from source content
